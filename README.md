# sqlalchemy_challenge

This project uses sqlalchemy and SQLlite to investigate weather phenomenon in Honolulu, HI over a seven year span. The jupyter notebook climate_analysis.ipynb queries the database for various aspects of weather over time, visualizes this data, and stores it in dateframes. The python file app.py then creates a list of apps using Flask that allow the user to query date ranges and weather metrics via a web app.
