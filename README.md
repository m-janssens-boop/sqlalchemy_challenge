# sqlalchemy_challenge

Background
--------
A climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii.

## Objective ##
Analyze and Explore the Climate Data. Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the following:
* Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the SQLite database.
* Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect the tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.
* Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
* Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis
#### Precipitation Analysis ####
- Find the most recent date in the dataset.
- Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.




#### Station Analysis ####
